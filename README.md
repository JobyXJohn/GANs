# GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks
In this notebook, a rudimentary GAN is implemented. Both the gnerator and the discriminator have just two layers, a leaky RELU and a tanh activation. Generator tries to create fakes from the MNIST data set. The result can be seen twoards the end of the notebook.
